RUNS=300
The ranges are in hours and rounded up.
0.5 - 1.5
29 Parameters
****************************************************************************************
A. 1.parameters_LHS.txt: List of all parameters to be varied in the model

B. MATLAB code to generate the LHS matrix. The parameter values were manually written in this code.
	Code:: ALHS_All.m
	O/P::  my.txt (29x300 matrix)
The ALHS_ALL.m uses the function LHS_Call.
Each parameter has a range from 0.5 to 1.5 of its original value.


C. Perl code to generate the 300 (runs) parameter files. 
It makes 48 changes in each file corresponding to the LHS matrix.
Matches the parameter present in the my.txt in parameters_1.txt and replaces them with its PRCC values.
300 files created for each of the 300 combinations.
Each of these parameter files would be used for further running of the model.
	Code:: C1_Parameter.pl
	I/P::  parameters_1.txt
	       my.txt
	O/P::  TEST_Parameter/New_i.txt i=0:299

The actual hours are n-1 (923 hours here means 922, as that data starts with a 0 Hour)

D. Z.Analysis  (See Annotation inside the folder)
	Main folder for the LHS results.
	This takes a cumulative of the all the hours from beginning of 1 cycle mentioned above to another.
	Cumulative sum is taken for the numbers.
	Cumulative mean is taken for the distances.
